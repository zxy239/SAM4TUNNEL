# SAM4TUN
This is a repo for paper of "SAM4TUN: No-Training Model for TBM Tunnel Point Cloud Component Segmentation" 

In this paper, we propose 'SAM4TUN', a zero-shot automated instance segmentation method for tunnel lining segments. It is based on a Large Vision Model (LVM), prompt-based Segment Anything Model(SAM), and various point cloud and image processing techniques, all without requiring any training. We unfold tunnel point clouds to generate 2D panoramic images, enabling SAM to be extended to point cloud segmentation. To enhance its capabilities, we propose: (i) a local point cloud density-variation-based method to filter out non-segment parts, and (ii) a geometry feature-guided multi-step point cloud up-sampling method to address uneven point cloud density during projection. Then, we focus on prompt engineering, using traditional image processing techniques to automatically generate template prompt, enabling SAM's zero-shot ability to achieve precise instance-level segmentation of tunnel linings. The results demonstrate that our no-training model achieved highly accurate instance segmentation, even surpassing supervised learning algorithms. The proposed method offers a novel approach for implementing tunnel point cloud component segmentation.
